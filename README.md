# ðŸŽˆ POP ðŸŽˆ
### *Plan, Organize, Procrastinate*
A planning tool with to-do lists and a calendar with the aim to help students plan their time and organize their school work. The tasks, which are added by the users, are visualized as balloons and can also be seen in a timeline for a better overview of what needs to be done. Once the task is done - just POP the balloon! 

The project was created as part of the course [System Development and Project I](https://edu.mau.se/sv/course/da336a) at [MalmÃ¶ University](https://mau.se/) by [Birger Norrman](https://github.com/BirgerNorrman), [Diana Klaar](https://github.com/dianaklaar), [Oscar Askfelt](https://github.com/oscaraskfelt), [Saga West](https://github.com/sagawest), and [Zandra Nilsson](https://github.com/zandrainilsson).
